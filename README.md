# Analog-Sound-System
A completely analog sound system designed and simulated on LTSpice, and built on breadboards.

The project was originally intended to be a novel completely-analog Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) Headphone design. But although the theory for cancellitaion was tested and worked on MATLAB, time constraints and other course-work did not allow a physical implemantation to be reached before the semester ends. Thus we handed in our project as a completely analog sound system, which already greatly surpassed the course's expection.

We might consider to continue our project and realize the ANC headphone in the near future.
