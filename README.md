# Analog-Sound-System
A completely analog sound system designed and simulated on LTSpice, and built on breadboards.

The project was originally intended to be a novel completely-analog Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) Headphone design. But although the theory for cancellation was tested and worked on MATLAB, time constraints and other course-work did not allow a physical implemantation to be reached before the semester ends. Thus we handed in our project as a completely analog sound system, which already greatly surpassed the course's expection.

The final report we handed in for the course is in the repo, it explains some concepts and includes some photos of the design.
We might consider to continue our project and realize the initially intented analog ANC headphone in the near future.
